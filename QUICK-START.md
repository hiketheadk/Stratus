# Quick Start Guide - Uploading to GitHub Pages

## Download Your Website Files

1. Download the entire `stratus-site` folder to your Mac
2. You should have all these files:
   - 9 HTML files (index.html, about.html, etc.)
   - css folder (with style.css inside)
   - README.md

## Upload to GitHub

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. **Drag the CONTENTS of the stratus-site folder** (not the folder itself)
   - Drag all 9 .html files
   - Drag the css folder
   - Drag README.md
4. Scroll down, click "Commit changes"

### Method 2: One-by-one Upload

If drag and drop doesn't work:
1. Upload all HTML files first
2. Then click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Type: `css/style.css`
4. Copy and paste the CSS content
5. Click "Commit"

## Enable GitHub Pages

1. Click "Settings" in your repository
2. Click "Pages" on the left
3. Under "Source", choose "main" branch
4. Click "Save"
5. Wait 2-5 minutes

## View Your Site

Your site will be at:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/
```

For example, if your username is `johndoe` and your repo is `stratus-website`:
```
https://johndoe.github.io/stratus-website/
```
